# The Problem is Not Their Paycheck

By Grant Botma

- According to some study, like 88% of employees "aren't living up to their potential". Employees just aren't motivated.

Why aren't they motivated.

## The Three Pillars of Motivation

- **Freedom**
- **Affirmation**
- A unified **Purpose**

### A similar study

This sounds uncannily similar to some other study I heard about that said motivation comes from **Agency** (cf freedom), **Competency** (cf affirmation), and **Purpose**.

In this other study, it was talking about having a sense of purpose in general. But this book seems to be talking about unifying all of your employees under the _same_ purpose, so they feel like they're part of something bigger.

Agency and freedom feel quite similar. The idea is that you are given the opportunity to make your own decisions about how to solve the problems at hand to reach the goal/purpose.

Competency and affirmation seem different in a nuanced way. Competency seemed to be referring to e.g. being good enough at a skill in order to have what it takes to attack a problem. (E.g. I'm competent as a programmer, therefore it helps me feel motivated to try hard at my software development job. Because I think I _can_ do a good job.) But in this book, the focus of the "affirmation" pillar seems to be the leader / manager affirming growth in the right direction of the employee. In other words, helping the employee to know that they're getting better at the right things, so that they themselves can feel that they're growing over the long term in the right direction.

## Freedom chapter

When you give employees more freedom, they respond not by taking advantage of you but by taking responsibility for their work. They need you less and less to get the job done.

## Affirmation chapter

> Three of the biggest poisons to a company culture: Uncertainty, lack of leadership, and lack of confidence.

- Affirmation means telling the employee when they've done a good job, (positive affirmation,) but also when they've messed. (Course correcting them; negative affirmation.)
- If it's awkward at first, start small. Write them a note.
- You might not be a "touchy feeley" type of person, and you might be focused on making money. But employees who are affirmed perform at a higher level! So they will end up making you more money.
- People want to know if they're doing a good job, so give affirmations immediately, on the spot. Don't wait until e.g. a quarterly performance review.

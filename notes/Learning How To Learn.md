## Lesson 1 - Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

- **Focused thinking:** Concentrating intently on something to learn it
- **Diffuse thinking:** "Relaxed" mode of thinking related to a set of neural resting states

In order to learn something difficult, your mind needs to go back and forth between Focused and Diffuse mode.

Metaphor and analogy are extremely powerful when trying to learn something new.

### Focused vs Diffuse Mode Example: Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali

Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison would both let themselves think in a relaxed state (Diffuse Mode), fidgeting with a key or ball bearings, and when they'd fall asleep the item(s) would fall to the floor and wake them up, and off they'd go into Focused Mode and apply what they'd thought of in Diffuse Mode.

### When do I find my mind most relaxed?

When going for a walk or laying in bed.

### Procrastination

When you perceive a difficult mental task, your brain interprets it as "painful". But when you spend a couple minutes performing the mental task, that perceived "pain" goes away. To apply this wisdom, use the pomodoro technique when facing feelings of procrastination.

### Working vs Long Term memory

Long Term memory is used to remember stuff like Spanish words ("chicharrones!") or a recipe.
Working memory is used to connect things we're learning in the moment in order to understand them. (New JS library.)

#### 4 Items

It's been long believed that Working Memory can hold about 7 items, but actually they've decided it can only hold about 4.

#### Fuzzy Blackboard

Working memory is like a blackboard, but a fuzzy blackboard; you have to keep repeating what you're learning in order to keep it in working memory. (e.g. Repeating a phone number until you can write it down.)

#### Spaced Repetition: Moving things into Long Term Memory

Use repetition over long periods of time. (e.g. Repeat a vocabulary word Monday, Tues, Thurs, Sat)

That leaves time for the "mortar" to dry in the "brick wall" of the memory you're building.

### Sleep and Learning

These are benefits of sleep:

 - Your brain gets toxins in it by being awake. Sleeping allows the toxins to be flushed out.
 - Sleep allows your brain to strengthen important parts of memories and "flush" unimportant parts.
 - During sleep, your brain "rehearses" difficult material you learned to solidify it.

## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

*What do you do to help yourself learn?*

I learn by doing -- jumping right in, learning from experts by osmosis.

*What do you do if you find yourself bored during a lecture?*

Ask a question.

 - You learn a lot more by active engagement than passive listening.
 - It's really hard to make the brain focus on something it's not interested in.

*What do you do to get into and take advantage of "diffuse mode" thinking?*

Exercise (go running). (And I take a notebook so I remember all the great ideas that bubble up!)

*Do you multitask? Or how do you resist the urge to multitask?*

Multitasking is necessary. But in the evenings I get to have lots of reflecting time.
Multitasking is context switching.

*How do you help your own learning using your own studies in neuroscience?*

1. I put myself in stimulating learning environments. Where there are events I can actively participate in.
2. Also, I exercise.

Both of these things help the brain to produce more neurons and increase connections.

**Kids need recess!**

*Are there any special techniques you've learned to help you learn more affectively?*

Putting myself in a stimulating, creative environment with lots of other creative people.

*How do you keep yourself creative in the face of the onslaught of daily tasks?*

Having youth around is helpful.

*Advice for young students on how to learn effectively?*

Success isn't about being smart. It's about being passionate and persistent.

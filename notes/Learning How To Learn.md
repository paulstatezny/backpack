## Key Concepts

1. Focused vs. Diffuse modes of thinking
2. Chunking

## Lesson 1 - Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

- **Focused thinking:** Concentrating intently on something to learn it
- **Diffuse thinking:** "Relaxed" mode of thinking related to a set of neural resting states

In order to learn something difficult, your mind needs to go back and forth between Focused and Diffuse mode.
Metaphor and analogy are extremely powerful when trying to learn something new. (Try coming up with a metaphor for what you're learning.)

Focused mode allows you to do *sequential thinking*. Diffuse mode allows you to do more holistic thinking that jumps around ("intuition").

> Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition (from Diffuse Mode) because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with.

### Focused vs Diffuse Mode Example: Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali

Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison would both let themselves think in a relaxed state (Diffuse Mode), fidgeting with a key or ball bearings, and when they'd fall asleep the item(s) would fall to the floor and wake them up, and off they'd go into Focused Mode and apply what they'd thought of in Diffuse Mode.

### When do I find my mind most relaxed?

When going for a walk or laying in bed.

### Procrastination

When you perceive a difficult mental task, your brain interprets it as "painful". But when you spend a couple minutes performing the mental task, that perceived "pain" goes away. To apply this wisdom, use the pomodoro technique when facing feelings of procrastination.

### Working vs Long Term memory

Long Term memory is used to remember stuff like Spanish words ("chicharrones!") or a recipe.
Working memory is used to connect things we're learning in the moment in order to understand them. (New JS library.)

#### 4 Items

It's been long believed that Working Memory can hold about 7 items, but actually they've decided it can only hold about 4.

#### Fuzzy Blackboard

Working memory is like a blackboard, but a fuzzy blackboard; you have to keep repeating what you're learning in order to keep it in working memory. (e.g. Repeating a phone number until you can write it down.)

#### Spaced Repetition: Moving things into Long Term Memory

Use repetition over long periods of time. (e.g. Repeat a vocabulary word Monday, Tues, Thurs, Sat)

That leaves time for the "mortar" to dry in the "brick wall" of the memory you're building.

### Sleep and Learning

These are benefits of sleep:

 - Your brain gets toxins in it by being awake. Sleeping allows the toxins to be flushed out.
 - Sleep allows your brain to strengthen important parts of memories and "flush" unimportant parts.
 - During sleep, your brain "rehearses" difficult material you learned to solidify it.

## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

*What do you do to help yourself learn?*

I learn by doing -- jumping right in, learning from experts by osmosis.

*What do you do if you find yourself bored during a lecture?*

Ask a question.

 - You learn a lot more by active engagement than passive listening.
 - It's really hard to make the brain focus on something it's not interested in.

*What do you do to get into and take advantage of "diffuse mode" thinking?*

Exercise (go running). (And I take a notebook so I remember all the great ideas that bubble up!)

*Do you multitask? Or how do you resist the urge to multitask?*

Multitasking is necessary. But in the evenings I get to have lots of reflecting time.
Multitasking is context switching.

*How do you help your own learning using your own studies in neuroscience?*

1. I put myself in stimulating learning environments. Where there are events I can actively participate in.
2. Also, I exercise.

Both of these things help the brain to produce more neurons and increase connections.

**Kids need recess!**

*Are there any special techniques you've learned to help you learn more affectively?*

Putting myself in a stimulating, creative environment with lots of other creative people.

*How do you keep yourself creative in the face of the onslaught of daily tasks?*

Having youth around is helpful.

*Advice for young students on how to learn effectively?*

Success isn't about being smart. It's about being passionate and persistent.

## Chunking

The first step to learning something is to start creating conceptual chunks -- mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

Chunk:
 - pieces of information that are bound together through use.
 - A network of neurons that are used to firing together, so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.

Small chunks become larger over time.
The point of chunks -- when you're sufficiently with something, you don't even have to think about it.
When we chunk something, it takes 1 of the 4 slots in our brain instead of all 4.

### How to Create Chunks

1. Focused attention
   (You can't gain understanding if you're distracted e.g. by music.)
2. Understanding
   (Not just being able to repeat instructed steps, but being able to see how things fit together.)
3. Practice
   (Looking at someone's painting doesn't mean you can paint yourself.)

### Top Down and Bottom Up Learning

Chunking is "bottom up"; Big Picture learning is "top down". Context is where the two meet.

## Illusions of Competence

### Importance of Recall

After you read a book, look away and see what you can remember.
When we retrieve information, we're not just being mindless robots. Retrieving information actually solidifies it!
Recalling information in a different environment than the one in which you learned it can help solidify it.

### Competence Illusions

Understanding what someone else says or does can trick you into thinking the problem is ingrained in your mind as a "chunk".
Highlighting text can give this illusion. But writing notes in the margin on the other hand can help.

### Mini Testing + Value of Making Mistakes

Testing yourself helps make sure you're not fooling yourself with "illusions of competence". Recall does this!
Making mistakes in self-tests are valuable. They help you correct your thinking and thereby solidify the concept in your brain.

# Procrastination and Memory

Learning is achieved when you build understanding bit-by-bit, like a brick wall is made by brick-by-brick. You cannot "cram" understanding. Therefore, procrastination is a huge threat to learning.

You can fight procrastination by building good habits. Habits are like zombies -- they're automatic, thoughtless processes. Habits can be good or bad.

4 Parts of a Habit:
1. The Cue (e.g. receiving a text)
2. The Routine (How your respond to the cue, e.g. getting distracted from work)
3. The Reward (The thing that releases "pleasure" feelings in the brain, e.g. moving your mind's focus away from difficult work)
4. The Belief (e.g. "I can't avoid looking at texts when I receive them")

Ways to build good habits and battle procrastination:
 - Watch for procrastination cues, and challenge the beliefs behind them.
 - "Eat your frogs first every day" (Do the unpleasant things on your to-do list first, to avoid procrastination)
 - Delay rewards until you finish a task that you're tempted to procrastinate on.
 - Keep a task list / planner journal so your "four tentacles" (of your "Octopus of Attention" -- representing your working memory slots) are not constantly having to juggle your todo list.

## Product vs Process

It's "products" (end goals) that tend to tempt us to procrastinate. (E.g. I need to finish this *homework assignment*, I need to be *ready for that presentation*, I need to *finish building the static UI*, I need to *lose 20 pounds*.)

"Processes" (e.g. *spending time reading*, *doing research for a presentation*, *exercising*) don't tempt us to procrastinate as much. Focusing on processes makes it easier to build a habit. They allow us to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

For example, instead of focusing on "I need to lose 20 pounds", forget about that and focus on having a schedule of working out 4 times a week for 40 minutes each. Do that, and before you know it you've started losing weight.

## Quitting Time

Planning your quitting time is important! It can help you not procrastinate.

## Procrastination and Willpower

If you're going to use willpower to fight procrastination (you should!) it's only going to be effective if you fight it at one point -- your reaction to The Cue.

## Overlearning

Definition: Continuing to practice something after you've mastered it. (This can be helpful by providing an amount of "automaticity", but can create an illusion of competence. Instead, move on to the things you haven't mastered.)

## Einstellung

Definition: When old patterns of thought block you from exploring / accepting new patterns or ideas.

## Interleaving

Definition: Jumping back and forth between different problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies.

Mix up your learning and it will expand your brain and draw out creativity.
